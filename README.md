# explicit_metacom_lottery

* main.jl
Code for metacommunity simulation

* Manifest.toml, Project.toml
Julia package control for the metacommunity simulation

* Complete_undir, Linear_undir, Grid_undir, Tree_undir, SmallWorld_undir
Connectivity matrix used as an input of the metacommunity simulation.
Total dispersal rate = 0.1 in each connectivity file. This parameter is adjustable inside main.jl

* Spatial_autocorrelation_optimization.ipynb
Codes used to run the optimization of spatial autocorrelation and to generate environmental conditions used in the metacommunity simulation

* N100...._Lowest, N100..._Mid, N100...Highest
Files to specify environmental conditions for each topology (specified by ...) with either lowest, intermediate, or highest spatial autocorrelation.
These files were generated by Spatial_autocorrelation_optimization.ipynb

* GiniSimpson.py
Function used to calculate alpha, beta, gamma diversity based on the Gini-Simipson index from abundance data (S x N matrix, an output of main.jl)

* SpeciesRichness.py
Function used to calculate alpha, beta, gamma diversity based on species richness from abundance data (S x N matrix, an output of main.jl)
